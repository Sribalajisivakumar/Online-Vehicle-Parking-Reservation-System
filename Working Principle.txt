Working Principle of the Online Vehicle Parking Reservation System
The online vehicle parking reservation system operates based on several core principles to streamline the process of reserving parking spaces. Below is an overview of its working principle:

1. User Registration and Authentication
Users need to create an account by providing personal details such as name, contact information, and vehicle details. Authentication is performed using login credentials (username and password).

2. Searching for Parking Availability
Users can search for available parking spaces in a specific location by entering criteria such as date, time, and location. The system then retrieves and displays a list of available parking spots that match the search criteria.

3. Reservation Process
Once a suitable parking space is identified, the user can proceed to make a reservation. This involves selecting the desired parking slot, specifying the duration, and confirming the booking.

4. Payment Integration
The system integrates with various payment gateways to facilitate secure online transactions. Users can pay for their reservations using credit/debit cards, digital wallets, or other online payment methods.

5. Confirmation and Notification
After the payment is successfully processed, the system generates a reservation confirmation which includes details such as reservation ID, parking spot number, and duration. Notifications are sent to the user via email or SMS.

6. Parking Space Management
Parking lot administrators can manage the availability of parking spaces through the system. They can update the status of parking slots, view upcoming reservations, and generate reports on usage patterns.

7. Check-in and Check-out
Upon arrival, users can check-in by scanning a QR code or entering their reservation details at the parking lot. Similarly, they can check-out when leaving, which updates the system to make the space available for other users.

8. Feedback and Support
The system allows users to provide feedback on their parking experience and access customer support for any issues encountered during the reservation process.

Detailed Workflow
